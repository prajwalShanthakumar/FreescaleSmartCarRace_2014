# FreescaleSmartCarRace_2014

This repository currently only contains a video that demonstrates robust sensing developed for the Freescale Smart Car Race.

Note the large variation in ambient lighting on the track with some areas brightly lit and other areas in shade. 

The Freescale Smart Car race is a competition where participating teams are provided with a kit consisting of the car chassis,
dc motors, servo motor, line scan camera, and a Freescale microcontroller board. The teams are free to mount the camera 
in any manner. Starter code for interfacing with the components is provided and the teams have to design and program the
sensing and control algorithms to drive the car autonomously.

Unfortunately, we could not participate in the 2014 version of the competition as it got postponed 
and we had graduated from college by the time it was rescheduled, making us ineligible to participate.
